function projection_test3

% tests whether we compute correct projection if the dimensions to which we want
% to project are not ordered, e.g. [3 1]:
% http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~mpt/hg/mpt?cs=4fd50f8eee77

% create random polytope in 3D
P = polytope(rand(10,3));

% project on 3rd and 1st dimension, we must preserve this order!
dim = [3 1];

% use vertex enumeration + convex hull -> this is the simplest method, we can't
% do anything wrong there
Q0 = projection(P, dim, struct('projection', 0));

% now test all other available solvers except of ESP - that one often fails
answ = [];
for sol = [1 2 3 5 6 7],
    Q = projection(P, dim, struct('projection', sol));
    % all projections must be equal 
    answ = [answ; sol Q==Q0];
    %mbg_asserttrue(Q == Q0);
end

% method no. 2 either passes or fails on a random basis, therefore we
% require that at least 5 methods pass
mbg_asserttrue(sum(answ(:, 2)) >= size(answ, 1)-1);
