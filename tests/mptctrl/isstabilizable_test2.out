Solution consists of 9 regions


ctrl=

Explicit MPC controller defined over 9 regions in 2D            
                                                                
   Controlled system: LTI system, 2 states, 1 input, 2 outputs  
   Control objective: horizon 1 optimal control problem (2-norm)
          Regulation: towards origin                            
          Invariance: the closed-loop system is invariant       
           Stability: the closed-loop system is stable          

 Type 'struct(ctrl)' to see all fields.
 Fields can be accessed directly, e.g. type 'ctrl.Pn' to get the controller partition.
