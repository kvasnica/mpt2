Explicit MPC controller defined over 9 regions in 2D            
                                                                
   Controlled system: LTI system, 2 states, 1 input, 2 outputs  
   Control objective: horizon 1 optimal control problem (2-norm)
          Regulation: towards origin                            
          Invariance: the closed-loop system is invariant       
           Stability: the closed-loop system is stable
