Controller with a search tree:

ctrl_st=

Explicit MPC controller defined over 5 regions in 1D            
                                                                
   Controlled system: LTI system, 1 state, 1 input, 1 output    
   Control objective: horizon 2 optimal control problem (2-norm)
          Regulation: towards origin                            
          Invariance: the closed-loop system is invariant       
           Stability: the closed-loop system is stable          

    Computation time: 2 secs
 Simplification done: none (run "ctrl_st=mpt_simplify(ctrl_st)" to perform simplification)

         Control law: 80 B (10 floats)
      Memory storage: 48 B (4 floats, 4 integers) (if implemented using a search tree)
         Search tree: 2 separating hyperplanes (depth 3)
Number of operations: 4 mutliplications, 8 additions, 3 comparisons
